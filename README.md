This proposal suggests amalgamation of artificial intelligence and blockchain to provide better, faster, and more secure healthcare facilities in digital space with a realistic experience.
Our proposed architecture can be summarized as follows. It consists of three environments, the doctor’s environment, patient’s environment, and the interaction environment. 
The doctors and patients interact in the interaction environment assisted by blockchain technology which ensures the safety, security, and privacy of data.
The interaction environment is the main part of our proposed architecture. 
The doctors, patients, and nurses enter this environment by registering on the blockchain and they are represented by digital avatars  in the interaction environment.
All the consultation activities between the doctor and the patient will be recorded and the data  will be gathered, transferred, and stored on the blockchain.
